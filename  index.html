    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p> Hi there! My name is Caroline Cerussi. I am a 28 year old <span style="color: rgb(248, 215, 27); font-family:Impact;">NEW YORK</span> native who has been living in Portland since 2015. I have a degree in Industrial Design from Pratt Institute, where I gained extensive experience in design strategies, concepts and practices. I have a passion in furniture building, which I utilized after graduating when I started my own furniture design company. From there, I branched into Interior Design and worked for Design Within Reach for 3 years, where I worked hands on with local Portland designers. My interest in coding came from my experience in the design world. I wanted to see what else I could create. With the help of Epicodus, my classmates, and teachers, I hope to become a great coder! </p>

    <p>Aside from design and work, I love puzzles, board games, hanging out with my friends, and contributing to my community.</p>
